In general, smaller loans have higher APRs. (See Figure 2.) One reason for this, as explained above, is that APRs are annualized, so they tend to be higher for loans with shorter terms. Another reason is that lendersâ€™ operating costs, which are charged to borrowers, are largely constant across all loans, so they are higher on a per-dollarloaned basis for small loans than for large ones. For example, a lender must pay its employees and pay rent for the branch regardless of how much is lent for any individual loan, and those fixed costs represent a much smaller share of the revenue from a $2,500 loan than from a $500 loan. Another reason is that installment loans often carry upfront acquisition or origination charges, which increase APRs far more for small loans than for larger loans. For example, a three-month loan with a fixed $50 origination fee and 36 percent interest will yield a 132 percent APR for a $300 loan and a 56 percent APR for a $1,500 loan.

These findings are largely consistent with data published by the states, which regulate loan sizes, interest rates, fees, the sale of credit insurance, and other terms, though the rules—and therefore loan structures and costs— differ significantly by state.21 Permissible stated APRs for small installment loans are usually far lower than for payday loans but higher than for credit cards. South Carolina publishes detailed data on finance charges and loan size; the most frequent stated APR in that state is 107 percent on loans of $600 to $1,000, and 88 percent for $1,000.01 to $2,500.22 A South Carolina rate chart from a large consumer finance company indicates an all-in APR of 101 percent for a $738 loan with a 12-month term.23 Other state regulatory data reveal the following costs and all-in APRs for a $740 loan that lasts 11 months: $294 and 72 percent in Alabama and Tennessee, $316 and 77 percent in Oklahoma, and $336 and 82 percent in Texas.
